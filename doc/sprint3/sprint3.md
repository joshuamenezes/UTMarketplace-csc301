# Sprint Goal

The goal for this sprint is to complete the epics listed in the Sprint 3 backlog. For the backend, user interaction with the website is of top priority. Most of the frontend framework is already complete. At the end of this sprint, users will be able to use basic functionalities of UTMarketplace such as editing, visiting profile, imaging for listing and profile picture, and bookmarking.

# Spikes

How to bookmark a listing for future reference
How to use imaging in Django
How to properly query database to sort data
How to delete account and with that, all postings of deleted account

# Team capacity

Since we are not working with 8 hour days, as a team we decided to complete 16 user stories for sprint 2 which will allow for the main user interaction with the website to work, and we decided that we have no more than 45 user stories in a single sprint. We also have documentation to complete during sprint 2.
