# Sprint Retrospective

#### The following team members were present:
* Andrew Qiu
* Arush Awasthi
* Chris Fernandes
* Joshua Menezes
* Renfrew Ao-leoung
* Tianyi Ma
* Zhongqi He

## Unfinished Tasks
* UT-7 Category Browsing (Partially complete, as we need to add more filters)

## Practices to Continue
* The frequency of meetings and consistent communication allowed our team consistently stay updated with progress.
* Reviewing each other's code also helped us to ensure that quality standards were being met and our product goals were being followed through.
* Working together on complex tasks helped alleviate the time it took to complete core components of the project

## New Practices
A new practice that we wish to incorporate into our development process is to implement a strict code style template. We noticed that some segments
of our codebase were very messy to read and caused some confusion when others had to work on a branch that another developer had previously worked on.
By having a strict code guideline, we would be able to solve this issue and also keep our codebase tidy.

## Harmful Practices to Stop
One practice we found that was harmful to our development was not following through on our code freeze. This caused us
a lot of rushing last minute to ensure that everything was working properly and was stressful for everyone on the team.

## Best Experience
The best experience we had was seeing our advanced features work. It gave us the impression that our project was really taking off and we all felt satisfied with our work.

## Worst Experience
The worst experience we had was during the testing phase and discovering hidden bugs that we needed to address prior to our demo. This combined with outstanding deadlines from other courses
was quite stressful for us to deal with.
