# Sprint Goal

The goal for this sprint is to complete the epics listed in the Sprint 1 backlog. For the backend, creation of accounts and authentication is the top priority for this sprint. For the frontend, creating a responsive webpage and login form is the top priority for this sprint. At the end of this sprint, users will be able to log in into UTMarketplace and log out.

# Spikes

* How to authenticate a University of Toronto student
* How to authenticate an administrator user
* How to encrypt user information properly
* How to have a bot email account that is used to reset user password

# Team capacity

Since we are not working with 8 hour days, as a team we decided to complete 26 user stories for sprint 1 which will allow for the account creation and authentication to work, and we decided that we have no more than 45 user stories in a single sprint. We also have documentation to complete during sprint 1.

# Decisions & User Stories & Subtasks
As a team, we decided to work on the frontend and backend components of having a user being able to log into UTMarketplace and making sure that their account is authenticated on creation. Through this decision, we then decided which tasks from the backlog to include into sprint 1, while making sure the work was doable within the timeframe of sprint 1.
