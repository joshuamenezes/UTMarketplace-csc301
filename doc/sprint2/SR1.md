## Unfinished Tasks
* UT-11 Verification of user emails upon account creation
* UT-24 Creation of item listings

## Practices to Continue
* The frequency of meetings and consistent communication allowed our team consistently stay updated with progress.
* Reviewing each other's code also helped us to ensure that quality standards were being met and our product goals were being followed through.

## New Practices
A new practice that we wish to incorporate into our development practices is placing a larger focus on features that have a bigger impact on our product than others. This is to ensure that the product has a strong foundation and is actually functional, rather than having implemented features that work, but are inoperable without base functionality.

In addition, we wish to utilize JIRA more thoroughly than we did in previous sprints in order to have a better grasp of where the project stands in terms of completion.

## Harmful Practices to Stop
One practice we found that was harmful to our development was our initial usage of Git. Our commit messages weren't as detailed as we wished them to be and didn't always follow a particular structure. This lead to a disorganized initial repository.

We also discovered that we were placing too much focus on simple tasks rather than focusing on core tasks that significantly contributed to basic functionality of the product.

## Best Experience
The best experience we had was connecting our frontend and backend together. We had initially split ourselves into two groups, each working on a respective task within the frontend and backend. Collaborating together and linking all of our hard work and dedication was stressfull, although enjoyable since we got to see our hard work pay off.

## Worst Experience
The worst experience we had occurred during the initial development phase. We were quite lost with JIRA and occasionally forgot to follow proper git flow, which lead to major disorganization. As a result, we clarified concerns we had with overall organization and are committing to the proper usage of JIRA and practicing a strict git flow to ensure that this does not occur again.
