# **Competition Analysis**
 
Our web application is solely for the UofT community, primarily UofT students. Post-secondary education is an expensive necessity and a marketplace aimed to sell previously owned goods can ease the financial burden that many students experience. The primary objective is to act as a marketplace where the UofT community can buy and sell student goods and services. 

There are many marketplaces available to the general public. Kijiji, eBay and Facebook Marketplace are competitors that focus on selling previously owned goods. Kijiji and Facebook Marketplace encourage selling locally, whereas eBay prompts online, global transactions. These companies have more resources than us, but they do not cater to any specific demographic. This is done in terms of profitability; if these companies switch to a niche market, then their consumer base will shrink and lose out on potential sales. Our web application provides a safer and more accessible environment to exchange student goods within the UofT community.

Users are required to sign up and verify with an email handle affiliated with the university. This requirement is done to ensure that everyone is within the UofT. This means that the listings will be more relevant to our consumer base and act as a deterrent against malicious users.
