# Sprint Goal

The goal for this sprint is to complete the epics listed in the Sprint 4 backlog. For the backend, user interaction with the website is of top priority and bug-fixing. Most of the frontend framework is already complete. At the end of this sprint, users will be able to use advanced functionalities of UTMarketplace such as searching, editing images, deleting listings, have recommendations.

# Spikes

How to deal with imaging in Django
How to have course recommendations
How to browse categories
How to report users

# Team capacity

Since we are not working with 8 hour days, as a team we decided to complete 20 user stories for sprint 4 which will allow for the main user interaction with the website to work, and we decided that we have no more than 45 user stories in a single sprint. We also have documentation to complete during sprint 4.

# Decisions & User Stories & Subtasks
As a team, we decided to all work together on the backend components of having a user being able to use the remaining functionalities of UTMarketplace that are to be implemented, such as searching, editing images, deleting listings, have recommendations. Through this decision, we then decided which tasks from the backlog to include into sprint 4, while making sure the work was doable within the time frame of sprint 4. Also since it is the last sprint, we have to do everything remaining anyways.
