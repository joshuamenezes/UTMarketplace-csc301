# Sprint Retrospective

#### The following team members were present:
* Andrew Qiu
* Arush Awasthi
* Chris Fernandes
* Joshua Menezes
* Renfrew Ao-leoung
* Tianyi Ma
* Zhongqi He

## Unfinished Tasks
* UT-15 Bookmark Listing for future access and use
* UT-20 Implement profile pictures for each user
* UT-16 Allow users to delete their account

## Practices to Continue
* The frequency of meetings and consistent communication allowed our team consistently stay updated with progress.
* Reviewing each other's code also helped us to ensure that quality standards were being met and our product goals were being followed through.
* Working together on complex tasks helped alleviate the time it took to complete core components of the project

## New Practices
A new practice that we wish to incorporate into our development practices is to implement a code freeze prior to deadlines. We found that we frequently tried to fix many of our issues 
last second and thought that having a code freeze would help ease this.

## Harmful Practices to Stop
One practice we found that was harmful to our development was leaving core features at the end and prioritizing smaller features first. Many of our features depended on these core features
being implemented and not having them implemented caused us some issues in the development.

## Best Experience
The best experience we had was seeing our advanced features work. It gave us the impression that our project was really taking off and we all felt satisfied with our work.

## Worst Experience
The worst experience we had was during the testing phase and discovering hidden bugs that we needed to address prior to our demo. This combined with outstanding deadlines from other courses
was quite stressful for us to deal with.
