# Process

## How did you organize the team?
We decided that everyone should get a chance to work with the front-end and the back-end. This decision will allow everyone to experience new tools and technologies. Every couple of weeks we will rotate roles. 

Sprint 0 tasks were divided in the following:
* process.md: Andrew, 
* PB.md: Chris, Renfrew, Arush, Tin
* personas.pdf: Arush, Joshua
* Team-contract.pdf: Eric
* Summary.md: Chris
* done.md: Joshua
* competition.md: Andrew
* ui: Eric, Tin, Andrew


## Which tools did you use, if any?
Our group communicated using Discord. We created a Discord server to organize our thoughts and ideas. Communication has been clear and effortless. 

For the Sprint 0 tasks, we primarily used Google Drive to store and share our work. This way everyone can easily access the files required for Sprint 0. For text based documents, we used Google Docs and Figma to design our UI. These tools prompt collaboration and allow us to work together.

We choose Xtensio to create our personas. Our team has experience with Xtensio which allowed us to create detailed personas. 


## How did you make decisions?
For our Sprint 0 tasks, we decided to split the work in individuals/sub-groups. Each individual/sub group made decisions on their own judgment and presented their completed tasks to the entire group. Everyone provided inputs and changes were made where necessary. All decisions were informal; the group has not experienced any split decisions.


## How did you define priority and/or points of user stories? How many rounds of voting (on average) did you need to come to a consensus for the point estimate?

As UofT students we can identify with the personsas. A safe and accessible platform to sell and buy our school needs is important. For the majority of priorities we did not have any difficulties to come to a conclusion. There were only two instances where we had to reevaluate our decisions. 



## How Frequently did you meet?
The group met every 2 - 3 days on Discord. Attendance has been perfect; no one has missed a meeting and everyone was punctual. The group also actively communicated outside of meeting times. 

Our first meeting was on January 14th, we decided what project we want to work on and the tools we use to develop. Our second meeting on January 21st, we walked through all the requirement listed on rubric and splited the tasks so that we will have everything other than Setup, done.md, Proccess, and README done by January 26th which is 2 days before the due date. Our third meeting was on January 24th, we each brought up each of our process on the tasks and read through each otherâ€™s work to make sure we are all on the same page. Our fourth meeting was on January 26th, we all brought up our semi-complete tasks up and made some last minute suggestion that what we had. Our fifth meetting was on Janyary 27th, at this point, we have completed majority of works and modified PB.md, and process.md


## What lessons should you take forward to the next phase?
* What we did well and should maintain doing for the future phases:

  * Started the project early so that we have enough time to have multiple meetings
  * Dividing tasks to individual tasks and team tasks such as typing up process.md and PB.md, where indivisual tasks are done in smaller group of 1-3 people and team tasks are done as a group during each meeting.
  * Post questions on Piazza or to CSC301 discord server when we encounter any problems

* What we can do better for the future phases:
  * Use different channel for different purposes instead of texting everything in general channel
