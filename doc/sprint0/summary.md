# Project Objective

UTMarketplace is a reputable platform with a sleek website design, responsive backend
system and an ever-growing user base. Our website and services provide a way for UofT
students to connect and trade various services such as buying/selling textbooks, used goods
such as laptops, tutoring and more. The user base will be exclusive to UofT students which
will ensure a convenient solution to UofT students who are looking for our services to
connect within the community.

# Key Personas

# George Harris - Recent High-School Graduate

George Harris, a 18 year old student who just got admitted into UofT, is looking to get the
perfect start on his post-secondary education. His goals are to succeed in his first year of
university, find all the tools required to aid his success and expand his network and make
friends.

# Catherine Huang - Cashier at Walmart

Catherine Huang is a 20 year old second year student double majoring in Psychology and
Anthropology in UofT and is working at Walmart to pay her student loans. She is always on
the lookout trying to find ways to save money and spend frugally, and is always busy with
work and school.

# Dhruv Choudhury - Software Engineer

Dhruv Choudhury is a 23 year old fourth year student majoring in Computer Science with a
new graduate job lined up after graduation. Dhruv is looking for some extra cash to spend on
relocating to San Francisco for his new job.

# Key Scenarios

# George Is Overwhelmed

George had to move from the U.S. to Canada to study at UofT and currently has no friends
who are also going to UofT with him. George is overwhelmed with school and is also
worried about his financial situation in terms of being able to pay for housing and tuition at


the same time. As George was scrambling upon his bed at 4 A.M. he received a notification
on his utoronto email to which information about the UTMarketplace website was linked.

George checks out the website and creates an account with his utoronto email. He finds out
which textbooks are required for class and searches the textbook category to hopefully find
someone selling their used textbook. To his luck, he finds a seller and now has a textbook at
50% of the original price, and he also became acquainted with the seller who told George
what to expect of the university life. George is now reassured in regards to UofT and has
saved some money allowing him to focus on his studies to succeed in his first year.

# Catherine Spends Too Much Time Browsing Shops

Every weekend, Catherine spends a large amount of time browsing multiple shops looking to
buy school supplies. To no avail, she is anxious about the cost of textbooks and supplies and
wishes to find cheaper alternatives. As a popular extrovert in the UofT community, some of
her friends recommended her to check out the UTMarketplace, to which she opens up.

Catherine is able to connect using her utoronto email and finds out that everything she has
been looking for in terms of school supplies is found on UTMarketplace. She makes a post to
sell her first year material and is searching for third year material to buy, to which she finds
multiple sellers and contacts them. Additionally, her laptop is very old and also found
someone selling their 2018 laptop after they graduated. Catherine was immensely happy with
the website and the people she contacted to buy her supplies, so she left them a good review
through the website’s rating and review scale.

# Dhruv’s Graduation

Dhruv has 4 years worth of textbooks he would like to sell. Furthermore he won’t be
requiring his laptop anymore as his new job will provide him with one, and that he is looking
for some extra cash even after selling all these supplies due to the cost of living being
immensely high in San Francisco. He is looking for a part-time job that will allow him to
fund his relocation.

Fortunately, Dhruv was the one who pitched the idea of UTMarketplace during his first year
of studies to the developers of UTMarketplace, and now he is able to use the website to his


needs. He lists all his textbooks and laptop for sale and is looking to sell his tutoring service
to the UofT community. It is important to Dhruv that UTMarketplace’s user base consists of
UofT students as he knows how rigorous the education is and would like to help the
community by tutoring people who require help.

# Key Principles

# Communication Is Key

From an outside perspective, working with software is commonly seen as a solo task. In
reality, working on a project requires working with a team and being able to communicate
different approaches to a task. Our team in particular has decided to have frequent meetings
to communicate our progress and with our flexibility we can dedicate time to always be
helping each other

# Minimum Viable Product Over Aesthetics

As a software developer, it is easy to get lost in tasks such as making the prettiest button or
optimising runtimes, however we want to prioritise our Minimum Viable Product so we can
complete our backlog tasks in time and not get overwhelmed with multiple tasks. With that
said, we really do value sleekness in our design philosophy and that we will definitely focus
on aesthetics after completing our Minimum Viable Product to make it appeal to the user
base.
