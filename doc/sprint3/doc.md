# General API
- the base endpoint is where the django server is running. Normally, it will run on localhost:8000
- all endpoint return html file.

# HTTP return codes
- **HTTP 200 OK** is normal return code, including the cases when forms raise validation errors.
- **HTTP 4xx** is the return code when the client sends informal requests. The issue is on the client side usually.
- **HTTP 403 Forbidden** is the return code when the client does not send the csrf token.
- **HTTP 404 Not Found** is the return code when the client send requests to a url not in server.
- **HTTP 5xx** is the return code when the server has errors. The issue is on the server side usually.

# Notes
- every form has a csrf token check. If the client does not send it, server will send HTTP 403 back.
- POST request must get sent to the url with a slash ('/'). Normally, if a user wants to try to get the page without a slash, server will append a slash and return the url. If clients use things like postman to send a POST request to a url without a slash, server will send HTTP 500 back.
- most of validation error and view error will still keep HTTP 200.
